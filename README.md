A digital media collection management web app

It is a web application which allows users to track a physical and digital media collection
(I have just limited it to movies for now but am working on adding other media options) where the end-user is personally able to manage their account including all their media content collection.

The specifics includes create/edit their account, add/edit/delete/view individual media items, and view/search their entire library.
